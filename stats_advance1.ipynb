    "*It is used to compare variances by examining the ratio of two independent chi-squared distributions divided by their respective degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Properties of the F-Distribution:\n",
    "1.Non-Negativity:\n",
    "The F-distribution is only defined for non-negative values (𝐹≥0), as it represents a ratio of variances, which are inherently non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Shape:\n",
    "The shape of the F-distribution is asymmetrical (positively skewed).\n",
    "As the degrees of freedom (𝑑1 and 𝑑2) increase, the distribution becomes less skewed and approaches a normal distribution.\n",

    "3.Degrees of Freedom:\n",
    "The F-distribution depends on two parameters:\n",
    "𝑑1(degrees of freedom for the numerator).\n",
    "𝑑2(degrees of freedom for the denominator).\n",
    "Larger values of 𝑑1 or 𝑑2 lead to a more symmetric shape.\n",
